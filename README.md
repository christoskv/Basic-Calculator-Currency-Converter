Demo Application for Interview Assignment 
=====================

I was tasked on creating a basic calculator app, that also has the functionality of converting the sum to different currencies. 
It is writen in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose and uses https://www.fixer.io for the currency convertions. (Free version: only supports convertions from EUR to any currency.)
For the purpose of this assignment I only picked a handful of available currencies, just to show proof of concept. 

You can find the apk on Releases, in order to try it.
